## Usage

To use the ShadowCipher, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository or download the `ShadowCipher.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `ShadowCipher.py` is located.
4. Run the following command:

   ``
   python ShadowCipher.py [-h] [-n COUNT] [-sv FILE_NAME] first_name last_name
``
-   Replace `first_name` with the target's first name.
-   Replace `last_name` with the target's last name.
-   Use the optional `-n` flag followed by the desired count to specify the number of words to generate (default: 100).

**Example**:
`python ShadowCipher.py -n 500 John Doe -sv johndoe_wordlist.txt` 

5.  The tool will generate a wordlist based on the provided names and display the total number of words generated.

## Warning

**Note:** Generating a large number of words (more than 50 million) may slow down your device. Use caution and consider the resources available on your system. If you want to exit the generation of the wordlist, you can use `CTRL + C` to exit/stop.
